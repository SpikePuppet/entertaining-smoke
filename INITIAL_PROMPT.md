We're going to make a small, online Brazilian Ju Jitsu tracking journal, that I can use to track my progress. We're going to do this in TypeScript and React, using NextJS. We should be able to do the following:

1. A user should be able to create an account, which will track all of their workouts
2. A user can create a workout, which will consist of a title (or we can randomly create a fun one, think like github), a description of the day, any highlight moves, what they think they did right, what they could improve on
3. A user should be able to see these in a list, and when clicked they should be able to see the previous journal entry
4. A user should be able to make a "promotion" entry, which has the level they got to and the date
5. Their current level should be reflected in the users account, so these new entries should update that

For the editor, let's use TipTap in order to ensure we have a good editing experience.  Also ensure this is visually appealing.

When it comes to hooking this stuff up to database or external services, stub that out and we will work together to get this hooked up when the time comes.
